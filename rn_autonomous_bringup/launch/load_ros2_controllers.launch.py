Launch ROS 2 controllers for the mecanum wheel robot.

This script creates a launch description that starts the necessary controllers
for operating the mecanum wheel robot in a specific sequence.

Launched Controllers:
    1. Joint State Broadcaster: Publishes joint states to /joint_states
    2. Mecanum Drive Controller: Controls the robot's mecanum drive movements via ~/cmd_vel
